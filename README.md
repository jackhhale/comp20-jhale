# Learning Portfolio

What I learned

### What is this purpose of this Git repository?

This Git repository holds the various projects I completed for Ming's Web Programming Course

### What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was the MBTA assignment. I thought the google maps API was well documented and fun to use. The assignment was interesting and useful in the real world. I felt like the project was something I/ others could actually use. I also felt a little bit of a chance to be creative with the assignment.

### How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I think I've grown a lot. The course pushed me outside of my comfort zone in solving problems unlike those from comp 11 and 15. I also learned a lot about the "real world" and jobs which I found very useful. 

### What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

The most important things I learned were a little bit of how web devlopment works and how to collaboarte with others. Assignment 3 is a good example of how web programming is different than what I've done in comp 11 and 15. I didn't know exactly what I was doing, but had to read and figure things out for myself even when they weren't well documented. Also Javascript's event-driven structure was interesting to learn. It is different, but interesting. The group porject is obviously a good example of how I learned to work with others. We have to divide work, share ideas, and push to git togeather. This pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me develop. I also learned the importance of networking.

### Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I'd like to dive more into creating applications to help people. I enjoyed using html + css + javascript to create a website. I like the creative aspect of making a website/ application. I don't know how similar it is, but I would be interested in learning about mobile app developemnt as well. I also want to dive deeper into the back-end side of web devlopment.
